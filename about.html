      <p class="about2">
        frontend developer who loves creating visually appealing and
        user-friendly web experiences. Right now, I’m immersing myself in HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript to build a solid foundation for my career in web
        development. As a self-motivated learner, I find joy in exploring the
        creative aspects of coding and bringing ideas to life with interactive
        designs. My goal is to master the essential skills needed to create
        responsive, dynamic, and accessible websites. Feel free to check out my
        portfolio to see my progress and some of the projects I’ve been working
        on as I develop my skills in frontend development!.
